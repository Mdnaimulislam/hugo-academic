We just started working with Dikai on material informatics. We aim to transfer the success of AI and machine learning in biological science to material science and adapt methods for drug discovery to the development of new materials. See [his profile page](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/materials/people/academic-staff/dikai-guan) for more information.
